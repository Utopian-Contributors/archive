# Technology that strengthens democracy

## Philosophy:

**Conserve cultures, take no orders**

- Take no orders, give no orders, facilitate conversation
- Conserve diverse cultures instead of one dominating in the name of progress
- Conserve the culture of the internet: end-to-end principle, open innovation

**Technology should deepen trust, not erode it**

- Openness and transparency create mutual trust
- Design for pro-social conversation that surfaces real feelings
- The superintelligence we're looking for is already here, it's us

## Digital Democracy:

**Design for consensus, not conflict**

- Build platforms that reveal convergence, not amplify extremes
- Increase the bandwidth and reduce the latency of governance

**Radical transparency as a principle**

- Work in the open, work out loud
- Democracy is a set of social technologies that can be upgraded

**Use humor over rumor**

- Counter disinformation with comedy and clarity, not censorship
- The best response to misinformation is faster, funnier, more shareable truth
- End-to-end encryption is a must

## Civic Technology:

**Fork it, make alternatives, not complaints**

- Civic tech is open for anyone to fork
- G0v created open source alternatives to government websites
- Bringing citizens into the same room as lawmakers changes everything

**Broadband is a human right**

- Empower the most remote citizen as much as the most connected
- The people who innovate with technology and bureaucracy are the same people

**Scale through participation, not control**

- Four people to 400 to 40,000
- Innovation happens when citizens and lawmakers deliberate in real time
- Let the younger generation lead experimentation

## On AI:

**AI-facilitated deliberation, not AI-driven decisions**

- AI can bridge people who are ideologically opposed
- Civic-minded AI means safety collaborations with global platforms
