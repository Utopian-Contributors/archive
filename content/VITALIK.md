# Tools, not empires

## Philosophy:

**Accelerate selectively, not blindly**

- Choose direction over speed
- Favor technologies that strengthen defense, decentralization, and human agency
- Build the digital equivalent of mountains and moats: cryptography, open protocols, distributed systems

## Decentralization:

**Replace trust with cryptographic proof**

- Never require users to trust a company, a board, or a server
- Make credible neutrality non-negotiable for infrastructure
- Back every claim of decentralization with concrete user guarantees

**Apply the walk-away test**

- If the builders vanish, users must keep their assets and the system must keep running
- Test for insider attacks: limit how much damage a rogue actor can cause

## Privacy:

**Treat privacy as the foundation of decentralization**

- Reject the false binary between privacy and verification. Use zero-knowledge proofs to get both
- Build defenses against AI-expanded surveillance now
- Improve security in the open. It is the only way for decentralized systems

## Public Goods:

**Fund what markets ignore**

- Use quadratic funding to amplify grassroots consensus over whale dominance
- Support it only if it is open source
- Prefer copyleft licenses to serve the commons

## AI & Human Agency:

**Keep humans as the steering wheel, AI as the engine**

- Keep human feedback central to every decision loop
- Expand human capability, never replace human judgment
- Prefer delay over monopoly

## Building:

**Build tools, not empires**

- Create interoperable systems, not walled gardens
- Make applications positive-sum with each other and with the wider world
- Let anyone in the world participate as user, observer, or developer on equal footing

**Make it cypherpunk again**

- Build toward a more free and open society, not just financial games
- Bring back the idealism
