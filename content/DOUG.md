# Augment human intellect

## Philosophy:

**Build tools that make humans collectively smarter**

- Co-evolve tools and human systems together
- Treat collective IQ as the variable to optimize
- Never stop at individual productivity

**Bootstrap the improvement process itself**

- Improve not just how you work, but the rate at which you improve how you work
- Use the tools you are building to support your own collaboration
- Create a positive feedback loop with no ceiling

## Collaboration:

**Design systems that let groups think together, not just communicate**

- Combine artifacts, language, methodology, and training into a single augmentation system
- Give teams shared views of their knowledge, not just shared files
- Track the evolution of ideas, not just decisions

## Tools:

**Treat the screen as a window into a working knowledge structure, not a page**

- Let people restructure, link, and navigate ideas fluidly
- Reduce the distance between a question and its answer in every interaction

**Show everything at once**

- Demonstrate real working systems, not slides
- Combine text editing, outlining, graphics, video, and remote collaboration live
- If you can imagine a better way to work, build it and show it
