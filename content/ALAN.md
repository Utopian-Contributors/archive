# The computer revolution

## Philosophy:

**The best way to predict the future is to invent it**

- Don't extrapolate from the present. Imagine what should exist and build it
- Change your point of view before working harder
- Choose the right frame, not the right answer

**Make simple things simple and complex things possible**

- Never force users to understand complexity they don't need
- Design systems children can use
- If an interface requires training, fix the abstraction

## Computing as Medium:

**Treat the computer as a metamedium, not a tool**

- Stop thinking of computers as tools. Think of them as a new literary form
- Control the full stack to get the experience right
- Don't let existing hardware constrain what software can become

## Software:

**Focus on how components communicate, not on what they contain**

- Design around message passing and late binding
- Crystallize a style. Don't agglutinate features
- Rewrite, don't patch
