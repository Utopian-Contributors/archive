# Don't trust

## Philosophy:

**Replace trust**

- Conventional currency requires too much trust to work
- Cryptographic proof removes the need for third party middlemen
- Base everything on proof instead of trust

**Decentralize or die**

- Centrally controlled systems get shut down
- Pure P2P networks hold their own against governments
- Decentralize from day one

## System Design:

**Build for zero single points of failure**

- No single point of failure in the system
- Users hold their own keys and transact directly
- Nodes can leave and rejoin at will

**Let the math speak for itself**

- Proof-of-work can be relayed through untrusted middlemen
- No chain of custody needed for communication
- It doesn't matter who tells you the longest chain

**Design for every possible future**

- Support every possible transaction type from the start
- Everything must be designed at the beginning to be possible later
- Once v0.1 ships, the core design is set in stone

## Economics:

**Scarcity creates value**

- Lost coins make everyone else's coins worth more
- Distribute at a constant rate
- In 20 years there will be very large volume or no volume

**Fair distribution through work**

- Difficulty scales with computing power to keep production constant
- Supply schedule is known in advance
- The utility of exchanges will far exceed the cost of electricity

## Building in Public:

**Ship and iterate with the community**

- A forum is enough to manage
- Let users help resolve the simple stuff
- Track every unresolved bug

**Don't waste time on skeptics**

- If you don't believe it or don't get it, move on
- Be better with code than with words

**Know when to walk away**

- The creator disappeared, and the system kept running perfectly
