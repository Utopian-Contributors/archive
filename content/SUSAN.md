# Make it friendly and humane

## Philosophy:

**Don't try to be original, just try to be good**

- Serve the user, not your ego
- Make an icon so clear you explain it once and they never forget it
- Design icons like traffic signs. Few details, universal meaning

**Be friendly. Make that part of the brief**

- Make technology warm and approachable
- Put a smile on the screen at startup
- Treat humane details as the experience, not decoration

## Design:

**Make things simple so you don't exclude anybody**

- Always make it universal
- Design for the first-time user, not the power user
- If a symbol needs a label to be understood, simplify the symbol

**Work within extreme constraints**

- Let a 32-by-32 pixel grid force absolute clarity of thought
- Treat pixel art like mosaics and needlepoint. Old crafts in a new medium
- Make every single pixel earn its place

## Craft:

**Borrow from the physical world**

- Use metaphors people already understand: a trash can, a paintbrush, a hand
- Root computer interfaces in everyday human experience
- Make the screen feel familiar before it feels futuristic

**Enjoy the creative process**

- Do not overthink what should be felt
- Let delight guide the design
