# Genius is simplicity

## Philosophy:

**When in doubt, use brute force**

- Pick the simple, obvious solution over the clever one
- Get it correct first, optimize later
- Resist adding anything that doesn't pull its weight

## Design:

**Make everything a file**

- Uniform interfaces enable unexpected composition
- Use pipes to turn small programs into building blocks for large ones
- Write programs that do one thing well

**Design for composition, not completeness**

- Connect small tools with text streams
- Do not build monoliths when a pipeline will do
- Let the user combine your tools in ways you did not anticipate

## Trust:

**Trust the people, not the code**

- Question every layer of abstraction beneath you
- Understand your compiler, your OS, and your hardware
- Learn new programming languages by writing programs in them
