# Information is power

## Philosophy:

**Share. It is a moral imperative**

- Those with access have a duty to share with those without
- Do not follow unjust laws
- Ask yourself what the most important thing you could be working on is. If you're not working on it, why not?

## Open Access:

**Take information wherever it is stored, make copies, and share them with the world**

- Download scientific journals and upload them to file-sharing networks
- Buy secret databases and put them on the web
- Add out-of-copyright works to the archive

**Build the infrastructure for freedom**

- Make the plumbing that lets information flow
- Write code that makes sharing easier, not harder
- Design systems that route around gatekeepers

## Building:

**Be curious, not successful**

- Build things because they are interesting, not because they are profitable
- Seek out the smartest people and work alongside them
- Write to understand, not to impress

**Force the change from the outside**

- Organize, build coalitions, and fight for what matters
- Do not look away
