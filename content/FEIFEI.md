# Build AI that serves humanity

## Philosophy:

**There is nothing artificial about artificial intelligence**

- AI is made by humans, for humans, to impact humans
- Be a person before being a technologist
- Technology reflects values

**Three principles of human-centered AI**

- Focus on human impact
- Augment humanity, not replace it
- Draw from the full complexity of human intelligence

## Democratizing Technology:

**AI's benefits have no borders**

- Breakthroughs anywhere can improve life everywhere
- Democratize the technology
- Give every individual agency over it

**Diversity is not optional, it is essential**

- Everyone at the steering wheel looked the same
- Encourage CS education among underrepresented groups
- Educate diverse thinkers and leaders

**Resource the public sector**

- The gap between AI-literate and AI-illiterate will have profound effects
- The public sector produces public goods, discovery, progress
- Build national infrastructure for academic and nonprofit researchers

## Building Responsibly:

**Never weaponize AI**

- Refuse any project that weaponizes AI
- Usage of technology is humanity's collective responsibility
- Guardrails and governance are necessary and inevitable

**Intelligence is nuanced, build accordingly**

- Human intelligence is emotional, compassionate, social, blind-spotted
- Build AI inspired by that nuance
- A machine making a perfect chess move while the room is on fire shows the limits

**Curiosity drives everything**

- Half-formed ideas and audacious questions start breakthroughs
- The question of intelligence matters more than other audacious questions
- The mission is to understand and empower the human mind

## On Governance:

**Educate before you regulate**

- Educate the public and policymakers about the power, limits, hype, and facts
- Then establish norms
- Build responsibly no matter who holds the technology
