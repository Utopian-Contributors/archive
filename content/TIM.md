# This is for everyone

## Philosophy:

**No central authority should control the web**

- Reject central computers, single networks, or organisations that "run" the web
- Treat the web as a space in which information exists, not a physical thing to own
- Create systems with common rules acceptable to everyone, as close as possible to no rules at all

**The web is a social creation, not a technical toy**

- Design for social effect. Help people work together
- Support and improve humanity's weblike existence in the world
- Build systems that require no one's permission to use or extend

## Ownership:

**Users must control their own data**

- Eliminate the asymmetry where platforms hold data and individuals do not
- Give customers control of their own data. Never tie them to a certain manufacturer
- Ensure personal data is owned by the individual, not by a corporation

**Decouple data from applications**

- Strip apps of ulterior motives that distract users with propositions to buy this or that
- Decouple content from applications so users avoid vendor lock-in
- Enable seamless switching between apps without losing any data or social connections

## Architecture:

**Decentralize everything**

- Empower the individual through decentralized architecture
- Remove central authorities that gate access behind permission
- Restore the feeling of individual control that centralized platforms have eroded

**Universality is non-negotiable**

- Guarantee access by everyone regardless of disability. Universality is the web's power
- Deliver the same information regardless of the device used to access it
- Ensure sites interact in one single, universal space

**Keep infrastructure royalty-free**

- Leave web infrastructure unfettered by patents, fees, royalties, or any other controls
- For the market to grow, the foundation must remain royalty-free
- Enable millions of innovators to design their own products on top of it

## Innovation:

**Build what you need, then give it away**

- Solve real frustrations. Build tools that are missing, not theoretical
- No one can predict what people will make
- Let half-formed ideas float around until one day they fit

**The future is still bigger than the past**

- The full potential of the web has not been seen yet
- In a creative medium, the only limits are imagination
- The pace of evolution will accelerate, not slow down

## Standards & Openness:

**Build on open standards, not proprietary platforms**

- Professionals must understand the use and value of standards
- Manage the web in an open way, free from bureaucracy, political pressure, and commercial capture
- Be conservative in output and liberal in what is accepted

**Interoperability over control**

- Never fragment the web. A split web loses its fundamental value
- Resist closed silos that erode the single, universal information space
- Prioritize interoperability in every architectural decision

**Personal empowerment through data**

- Reject the model where users hand over personal data to digital giants in exchange for perceived value
- Give every user a choice about where data is stored, who can access it, and which apps are used
- Design apps that collaborate to enrich personal life, not compete for attention

**The read-write web**

- Restore the web as a collaborative space for sharing information, not just consuming it
- Push beyond open data toward true read-write data
- Build a web people can trust. Apps that help without spying on them
